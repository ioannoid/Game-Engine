# Game-Engine
Game engine developed in C++ with OpenGL designed to be highly user customizable, while also mainting simple usability and efficiency. Mainly for use in a game that I am currently working on called Divitiae. Most features still need to be added (slowly mind you) with only basic support for event handling, texture loading, and shader loading currently available.
